            <h2>Holistic Tax Management</h2>
            <div class="section-line"></div>
        </div>
        <div class="tp-philosophy reveal-up">
            <p>Tax planning is not merely about saving tax under Section 80C. It is a year-round, strategic process of aligning every rupee you earn, invest, and spend with tax-efficiency. With the <strong>New Tax Regime (Section 115BAC)</strong> becoming the default from FY 2023-24 onwards, the paradigm has shifted from <em>"forced saving via deductions"</em> to <em>"conscious investing with lower rates."</em></p>
            <p>Our approach evaluates your complete financial profile — salary structure, capital gains, rental income, business receipts, and existing investments — to mathematically determine whether the <strong>Old Regime</strong> (with deductions like 80C, 80D, 24b, HRA) or the <strong>New Regime</strong> (with reduced slab rates and ₹75,000 standard deduction) leaves more cash in your hand. The objective is not to blindly invest in tax-saving instruments but to invest <em>smartly</em> where your money grows while also saving tax.</p>

                </div>
                <h3>Regime Selection Analysis</h3>
                <p>Standard Deduction is now ₹75,000 under New Regime. We run a side-by-side mathematical comparison factoring in your HRA, 80C, 80D, NPS, and home loan deductions to determine your optimal regime. The breakeven point is typically around ₹3.75 Lakh in total deductions.</p>

                <h3>Capital Gains Harvesting</h3>
                <p>Strategically book Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) from equity each year to utilize the ₹1.25 Lakh annual tax-free exemption. This technique resets your cost base, effectively making future gains tax-free — a wealth compounding multiplier used by sophisticated investors.</p>

                </div>
                <h3>Health & Insurance Optimization</h3>
                <p>Maximize Section 80D deductions up to ₹1 Lakh by covering self (₹25K), family (₹25K), and senior citizen parents (₹50K) with adequate health insurance. Add preventive health check-up claims of ₹5,000 within the overall limit for complete coverage.</p>

                <h3>HRA Exemption Planning</h3>
                <p>One of the largest single tax-saving components for salaried individuals living in rented accommodation. The exemption is the <strong>minimum</strong> of three values:</p>
                <ul class="tp-salary-list">
                    <li>Actual HRA received from employer</li>
                    <li>50% of Basic Salary (Metro) or 40% (Non-metro)</li>
                    <li>Rent Paid minus 10% of Basic Salary</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="tp-salary-tip">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> You can legally pay rent to your parents (if they own the house) and claim HRA. They must declare it as rental income, but the net family tax saving is often significant.

                <h3>Meal Vouchers & Food Coupons</h3>
                <p>Meal vouchers (Sodexo/Ticket Restaurant) provided by your employer are <strong>exempt up to ₹50 per meal</strong>. For 22 working days per month, this translates to ₹26,400 annually tax-free — a completely legal and often overlooked benefit.</p>
                <div class="tp-salary-tip">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Request your HR to include meal coupons in your CTC restructuring during appraisal season. It directly reduces taxable income.

                <h3>Company Car Lease Policy</h3>
                <p>Opting for a company-leased car saves tax on EMI, maintenance, insurance, and even driver salary — all paid from <strong>pre-tax CTC components</strong>. The perquisite value charged is significantly lower than the actual benefit received.</p>
                <div class="tp-salary-tip">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> Compare the total tax saving against taking a car loan yourself. For vehicles above ₹10L, the lease route almost always wins.

                <p>Exemption can be claimed <strong>twice in a block of 4 years</strong> for domestic travel (travel fare only, not hotel/food). Current block: 2022-2025. Covers air, rail, or road fare for self and immediate family.</p>
                <div class="tp-salary-tip">
                    <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> If you didn't claim in the current block, you can carry one unclaimed journey to the first year of the next block.
